      <h1>Victor Mora's Portfolio</h1>
      <p>Hello! My name is Victor, and I am a student
          at Brown University! I love studying Neuroscience and 
          Computer Science, and in the future you can find cool
          things that I learn, make, and do here!</p>
      <p>This is my portfolio.</p>

      <p>Some more information about me:</p>
      <p>I am originally from southern California, but I now
          go to school in Rhode Island! My older sister still 
          goes to school in California. 
      </p>
      <p> My favorite book series is the Inheritance cycle 
          (think Eragon), and my favorite hobby is strength training!
